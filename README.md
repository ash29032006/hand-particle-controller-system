##  Features that make you go "WOW"

### The "Supernova" Blast
Clench your fist tightly (>65% tension) to trigger a massive **explosive event**.
- **Visuals**: Particles blast outward in a violent red shockwave.
- **Feedback**: A massive **"BOOM!"** overlay strikes the screen.
- **Immersion**: The camera shakes and the universe pulses with energy.

###  Elegant Glassmorphism UI
- A modern, translucent control panel that floats over the scene.
- Real-time tracking status with a glowing neon indicator.
- Fully responsive design with smooth hover effects.

### 3D Shape Morphing
Seamlessly transform the particle cloud into various forms:
-  **Sphere** (Default)
-  **Heart**
-  **Flower**
-  **Saturn** (with rings!)
-  **Buddha**
-  **Fireworks**

###  Cinematic Post-Processing
- **Unreal Bloom**: Particles glow with an ethereal light using high-dynamic-range (HDR) bloom.
- **Deep Space Fog**: Adds depth and mystery to the background.
- **Dynamic Color**: Cycles through the spectrum when idle, or reacts to your gestures.
